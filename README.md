# Rainstorm-Specific Release Actions

The reusable GitHub Actions in this repository make it easier to define release
workflows for repositories owned by
the [Rainstorm](https://github.com/rainstormy) organisation:

- [`rainstormy/rainstorm-release/bot-nimbus`](./bot-nimbus/README.md)
  sets [Nimbus (Bot)](https://github.com/rainstormybot-nimbus) as the user in
  Git.
